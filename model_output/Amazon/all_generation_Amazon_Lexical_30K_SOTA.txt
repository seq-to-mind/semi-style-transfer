this is honestly the best case i thrown away in the garbage .
what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other good products .
it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends .
it was supposed to be a complete toy .
i guess it s really a matter of preference .
this case is great and what i expected .
obviously we all have our own preferences for taste .
the cables seem rather basic and work well , except one problem .
i am actually happy with the remaining jars .
these make great little night lights for the kids .
i see what others have liked about this .
the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was good .
