around the same time my dad got his very first iphone . 
it can charge a usb device while charging your phone . 
after about a week ,  the whole basement was a little clearer . 
i wasn t expecting much because theprice was so low . 
it is generic product ,  but worth every single penny . 
this headset can take a lot of abuse . 
just the right size for the in between jobs . 
battery life is a little less than other phones we have had but still lasts all day . 
if you want a fun way to protect your phone ,  this is the way . 
very small but it works great in the car . 
i can hear a noticeable amount of hiss and loss of clarity . 
then i worried about the quality and whether or not it would look cheap and flimsy . 
that you have to remove ,  but i don t consider this a drawback . 
i don t see how you can beat that . 
i had been looking for a long time and i am delighted with the set . 
the dogtag chain relieves strain from the earbuds and can be hidden discreetly under your shirt . 
i don t own much expensive cookware ,  although i wish i could afford it . 
from a distance i have people say they could not tell that it was a phone case !  . 
first ,  one corner of the case doesn t snap on real well ,  and when dropped ,  it pops off a little . 
for the price ,  this knife does the job . 
best case out there for an extended battery . 
just have to be patient in installing ,  also have really steady hands . 
i did a lot of research before buying this processor . 
nice pan !  this pizza pan is a great size . 
i don t mind that and just get another one . 
does require a bit of guess work ,  but still not difficult . 
this is the best blade grinder i have found . 
great item ,  highly rated by my fave cooking mag from the east coast that has a pbs tv show . 
i m sure they will stay fresher in the jars than in the bag with a close pin . 
you would think the description would say  hose sold separately  or something to that effect . 
i really loved it and will use it alot . 
we got this kit for our daughters num_extend birthday kit to make her cake . 
not totally regularly shaped ,  and look a little cheap . 
love the quality stainless ,  as well as the long slender design . 
while i own a ceramic sharpening device ,  i still haven t had to use it on either knife . 
look great !  neutral to go with any curtain color . 
the nonstick coating is just as good ,  if not better than other commercial grill pans . 
charge performance is quick and handles all that i throw at it . 
the water is just as tasteless ,  but the flow is much better . 
this roughness allows for food to stick on the skillet more than on those other types of skillets . 
most of this can be resolved by rooting the phone and putting a custom rom on num_extend
nice cover ,  cheap price ,  easy to install ,  fit the motorola photon perfect . 
i can roast vegetables quickly in it ,  and even bake muffins . 
there were campsites where i was the only one with cell service . 
i have the silicone handle which helps prevent burns . 
preheat the press with hot water while getting coffee ground and heating water . 
boil water until timer darkens to your specific needs . 
then use the back of a spoon to smooth the label ,  thereby increasing the adhesive strength . 
nokia suite will offer to upgrade the software from num_extend to symbian anna . 
you will not believe this .  .  . this zyliss is an amazing kitchen tool . 
if you have a choice ,  i would definitely research shun and henckel . 
the bottle is leak resistant with zero condensation . 
you have evenly cooked ,  crispy pizzelles in no time . 
so i was happy to find this ,  seasoned it and used it a few times ,  now it s perfect . 
pour boiling water into the bottom reservoir  with bottom filter removed  ,  one half inch from the top . 
we re using ciao bella book of gelato and highly recommend the purchase of this book with the lello . 
fits very well and is durable plastic for good protection . 
the business i work at is very problematic for cell phone reception . 
it gets the job done and for the price you can t beat it . 
son has this on his nokia num_num and with use and abuse ,  this protective hard skin works perfectly . 
i used almost all of my christmas bonus ,  in num_extend to buy the dyson animal num_extend
the pictures will show two spots ,  one half of one i had already cleaned before i took the picture . 
and dont want to carry a purse or wallet . 
it works perfectly !  i m very happy with the price ,  the product and how quickly it arrived . 
blade is really sharp and got the results that i was expecting . 
after looking around at other products like this such as the incipio feather and casemate barely there . 
this vornado heater is pure luxury to me . 
my husband usually uses my hand mixer beater to whisk sauces . 
this machine is easy to use ,  just plug and go . 
however ,  the overall sound quality both ways is better and the fit is more comfortable than the jawbone . 
this will be my second of these scrapers . 
don t give this amazing tool a bad review just because you were sent a different model . 
not a big deal ,  but much larger than i expected . 
i am very happy with the purchase and the installation was easy . 
i have owned any number of strainers over the years ,  but never one like this . 
it seems that all of the family didn t have enough chargers . 
they re my favorite glasses for serving up mixed drinks . 
it really just sits lightly over your ear . 
it comes with a dough hook too even though i didn t see it in the description . 
i liked it so much ,  i ordered an additional one for my hubby . 
i bought this on amazon quite some time ago . 
everyone recommends this knife ,  so no one will read this comment . 
very highly recommended because of their quality and how heavy and sturdy the glass is . 
i was familiar with corelle already so i knew they would never break or chip . 
i purchased a few of these to keep at different locations . 
it s not like real espresso ,  but it gets as close as you can for very little money . 
the meat is only partially thawed when i slice it ,  but it works great . 
i bought this pan specifically to make corn bread . 
the wide top reduces and concentrates flavors amazingly fast . 
great price and it noticeably filters tap water that i can smell coming out of the faucet . 
i needed this for canning items that don t do well with oxygrn absorbers like sugar . 
for this price $ for what looks like same case in mall  it is a real winner . 
i ve been a fan of otterbox products for a long time . 
give it a chance ,  you won t be disappointed !  . 
i wanted to make strawberry and i had some frozen ones that i had thawed . 
who knew .  .  .  . i followed both machine recipes for basic bread . 
it is easy to use and fits the iphone num_num great . 
i can t speak for the white one but the black one did crack around the volume buttons . 
this is a manuel machine ,  but it works great . 
wish i didn t have to buy two though . 
i needed a set with a goldtone accent to go with my gold rimmed plates . 
this pan performed great searing and then braising of pork chops . 
this machine just keeps on brewing and frothing . 
oh ,  by the way .  .  . you can wash these holsters ,  too . 
the extra life of these batteries was overrated . 
i wish there was an option for better than perfect service as this company deserves it . 
this is good since you would have to convert your own recipes to the above proportions . 
they are very comfortable in your ears and people can hear you very well . 
but ,  a huge disappointment was the lid !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  the paperwork that came with the jar says made in the usa . 
five days a week we use the beeps as our alarm clock . 
so ,  it won t bother me when i work . 
being a mom of small kids ,  i can certainly say :  can not do without it . 
it also will tell you when you have turned it off . 
i have given several way as gifts and they were all pleased . 
practical tips for quick and sure assembly :  num_extend
i have bought two additional ones for gifts and have had dozens more bought by my recommendation . 
my first tuna asparagus creeps in cream sauce were a success . 
it looks great and i hang most of my pots and pans from it .  .  . and we re talking cast iron here . 
it grinds grains without making too much noise . 
awesome stylus !  perfect weight ,  size and love this type of tip . 
iced tea machine for many years ,  but i think this product is far superior . 
i really like how sturdy they are and how clear they look . 
worth buying a few or more to have in the car ,  briefcase ,  house and whatnot . 
so ,  you always have to have a hot pad or towel num_extend
i hastily ordered her another one and it arrived on time . 
they really are invalueable and worth every penny . 
the price is right and so is the item . try it , you ll like it too . 
they give you everything you need and its worth the price although the iphone shield prices are pretty good . 
but i ve seen many people with this so thought i would give it a try . 
i thought it would be hard to replace but watched video on youtube and worked out fine . 
dust ,  sand ,  dog hair ,  cat hair and a leaf . 
shaped a little weird ,  but is an awesome fan . 
the excellent instruction manual that comes with this cooker lists appropriate cooking times for many kinds of food . 
it isn t very convenient though compared to a real lid . 
they proceed faster when the wine is warm and slow down when it s cool . 
these knives are made in china from stamped stainless steel ,  as indicated in the specs . an explanation :  j . a . 
very durable and total molded design is great . 
it charges anything that uses usb ,  just like you d expect . 
also it is larger than it looks in the picture !  . 
i have purchased these for gifts as well . 
i m an avid amateur cook ,  and love entertaining . 
this product is excellent and unlike the comment in one review ,  i have noticed no plastic taste . 
frost color looks nice on the cell phone and feels durable . 
this is extremely important to avoid any num_extend the lid grip is thin and hard to remove . 
guess it has been a while since i had used or needed a double boiler ?  !  . 
most new phones are going to soft buttons . 
they gave me a week to see if any more problems popped up . 
looks brand new ,  already made a few things and it seems to work perfectly . 
a year and a half with two kids and no casualties so far . 
i love just looking at it ,  but i love it even more using it . 
there needs to be room at the top of kettle to contain boiling water . 
the price was right and it came very quickly after i ordered it . 
and a quicker path through the filter results in incomplete brewing ,  and ,  bitterness . 
the sound is alright but they are good because they block outside sounds . 
when my old one finally rusted away  after num_num years  ,  i was thrilled to find this as a replacement . 
i m saving my receipt and if that happens i ll be very disappointed . 
i have gotten no complaints from people i call and am on the phone a lot . 
i am a first time user so am not an expert . 
it still cooks great and cleans as easy as it did new . 
do it right and it will make a nice seal . 
it also allows sending text messages through desktop  when phone is connected  . 
it works like a charm and you really get a very similar product . 
this little tool is perfect and can t understand why i never invested in one before . 
seems to be in great condition ,  arrived very quickly . 
all stainless ,  so don t worry about wearing anything out . 
i changed screen protectors twice i believe in a matter of nearly a year . 
this was an easy fix up for the board . 
will review again when i have more experience with it . 
this knife was no exception to that; razor sharp out of the box . 
i have tried all manner of other ways to integrate my iphone easily with my car . 
this is about the same size with the same size screen . 
if you own a evo you should own this as well . 
i ordered a trailer ball and it was in the same box packed loose . 
nice and heavy ,  very solid and easy to use because of the heft . 
the incredible was a great phone for the most part but it ate through battery . 
but this headset works really well and also obviously can stand up to some unique challenges . 
yeah ,  i complain about cleaning it ,  but as far as juicers go ,  this one is easy to clean . 
i even wrote to krups and was not given any explanation . 
this one was just as good as my old one !  i was so glad !  . 
i thought they were so cute i even put one on my daddy s ipad . 
to activate discoverable mode you simply press and hold the call button until the bluetooth indicator starts flashing . 
i bought these because my zaggs wouldn t stay on while running . 
the key .  .  . you have to remove the phone from the case ,  which is very inconvenient !  . 
the key number to pay attention to is the second one ,  the rated amperage . 
i got the recommendation from cooks illustrated ,  and it works like a charm . 
i paired it to my cell phone in a matter of seconds with absolutely no problems . 
this is very nice i had to register this handset . 
it is a nice heavy glass and if used for what it was intended for it will last forever . 
i would never have even thought about purchasing anything that was reconditioned until i read the reviews here . 
i m hoping we have many years of trouble free use with this machine . 
i use these with iphone num_extend and a blackberry curve+ auto shutoff after the phone moves out of range . 
the light indicators for the battery life and connection status are wonderful . 
will work well with cheese ball and crackers or small slices of pound cake ,  etc . 
i bought this one because the original cable i had was ripping apart . 
it works for my iphone num_num that needed a new battery . 
i switch battery s often so i need to be able to remove the cover easily . 
i highly recommend them and for the price i don t see how you could beat them . 
the back plate offers great protection and new charging options . 
very handy ,  size is great but everytime i use ,  it seems to take a little bit more finish off . 
compare vendors shipping charges as well as the unit price for your best purchase price . 
that is a bit awkward but eventually it worked . 
if you take good care of the cast iron dutch oven ,  it ll serve you very well and your generations . 
it is a classic design that is beautiful enough to leave out in the open . 
but the thing is ,  i don t think they should bend . 
it s sturdy and well made ,  i m very happy with the purchase . 
i need to up my game to keep up with my new board . 
i have had my cuisinart machine for num_extend years . 
she had been using an otterbox commuter but was dissatisfied with that case s bulk . 
when i look at its picture while ordering i never think it should be same as in the pics . 
i mounted some cambridge soundworks surround speakers on the stands with no problems . 
i am very attached to certain wooden spoons .  .  . i use different spoons for different sorts of stirring . 
the outside chrome part ,  does get very hot . 
and they make the phone easier to grip while protecting the surface . 
voice guide is great and answering with my voice is faster than i though . 
of course ,  you ll probably figure that out for yourself . 
this is a must have for anyone who has a cell phone . 
charges my nokia num_extend at a fairly fast rate . 
one being the loudness of the unit seemed a tad low ,  and the fit didn t seem quite right . 
i had no feeding or jamming problems whatsoever . my only issue with this device is using it to stuff sausages . 
excellent peeler ! so many peelers just don t work that well . 
i gave it the benefit of the doubt and used it anyway . 
for me ,  this handle is too big ,  and i feel like my wrist is an awkward angle . 
great quality stainless steel ,  good weight ,  nice looking !  i love all the oxo products i have . 
is it a wonder why this coffee grinder is rated number num_extend
its a neck lanyard which is pretty standard . 
i just received this guy yesterday and tried it out last night with a large sweet potato . 
the turkey fit nicely in the pan and came out very moist and flavorful . 
it is basically just a big luggage tag ,  but it does an adequate job . 
update :  my newest sanyo microwave convection oven quit after working for a little over two years . 
i highly recommend it !  you will not be disappointed . 
as for the pan itself ,  i couldn t be happier with it . 
the flashlight is not very bright ,  i would say about as bright as a keychain flashlight ,  if that . 
you release the lock mechanism at the top and press down . 
use wooden or plastic utensils and you won t scratch the finish . 
the blender does what a usual blender is supposed to do . 
but ,  i would not suggest blending anything hard  like ice  in a canning jar . 
i bought num_num sizes of the golden holiday tablecloth and matching place mats . 
what a well made docking device !  this was one of the fastest shipped items i have purchased from amazon . 
my only complaint is the latch that keeps it shut ,  is a little aggrivating . 
everything sticks and it s a bear to clean . 
you can also rotate it to fit it in your left or right ear . 
it is really handy !  my cabinet was a mess and this helped me to get things better organized . 
i thought it would be a little tricky to clean the blades but it couldn t be easier . 
cost $ and had plenty to choose from . 
i love the blade cover; that s probably my favorite part about this . 
i was able to sync this within about num_num minute to my droid num_extend
there are different types of burr grinders but the conical type is supposed to be the best . 
everything fits perfectly in the case and it makes everything much neater . 
i love the look of this charger first off . 
for the oat flour .  .  . also use an equal amount of whole wheat flour .  .  . i have been using  quakers   old fashion oats  . 
the agility has a removable hood making this area easy to clean . 
otherwise ,  the calls seem good on this plantronics num_extend bluetooth earpiece . 
a also like the web strap underneath it fits about num_num wash cloths . 
this pan is a wonderful addition to my calphalon collection . 
they are sturdy yet beautiful ,  and are the perfect size for pasta ,  casseroles ,  rice dishes ,  and more . 
the numbers on each are etched solidly into the rubber handgrips ,  ensuring they won t disappear anytime soon . 
this phone is really cool and i recommend it for anyone looking for a bad ass phone . 
great for cutting ,  chopping and scraping ,  i wonder what i used to use before i got one of these . 
i ve only used these pans a few times ,  so far ,  but they re working out great . 
at its current price of less than $ it s really a steal as well . 
most of the time ,  the person on the other side didn t notice that i was on a bluetooth . 
the powerful motor is more than enough for any job . 
it s had the best crema on my espresso this side of italy . 
i just loved the colors when i saw this and had to have it . 
the chopsticks are nice ,  and come with grips on them for extra  grabbing  power . 
my charger works just fine .  .  . it charges my phone quickly . 
they fit on very snugly ,  and the screen is just as sensitive as when the phone is bare . 
and then there are the general uses ,  the logical ones that come to mind .  .  . closing bags of chips and crackers . 
buy more than you think you need ,  you ll use  em . 
the sound quality is amazing for music and phone conversations . 
don t put in ear while crazy glue is wet . 
only a percolator perfectionist would really notice that difference . 
after that i gave the slicer another chance . 
highly recommend these to people to use on their whiteboards or refrigerators . 
i have purchased these glasses num_num times now to have them engraved for going away gifts . 
used this to shove into doughnut holes  i cheated on actual cake pops  . 
this was a really good price for the cord . 
sometimes i have to keep mobile in dusty places . 
there is no  jumping around  of the appliance on the counter when it s in use . 
there is a size or two up that i like the best from oxo however . 
i like this sifter especially for making cakes that require folding in sifted ingredients in portions at a time . 
it eliminates sediment and any traces of bitterness . 
this one was at a great price and it works well . 
and even better ,  nobody can compare with kitchenaid s customer service care centeer . 
i had never defrosted anything in a microwave that didn t get cooked on the edges until now . 
it s ideal for those recipes that combine measures ,  e . g .  ,   one cup plus two tablespoons of sugar  . 
brita makes a great product ,  and the price on amazon makes it worth buying here . 
i d recommend it for anyone that wants easy access to their credit cards and id . 
if you love apples and pears ,  this is a must have tool . 
that s the only reason i didn t give it five stars . 
i personally have no need for a kickstand so this works great . 
i ve had my case for about num_num months now and use it everyday . 
rv s are subject to much dust not to mention we change environments  pollen types  on a continuing basis . 
as a former commercial meat cutter i ve had years of experience with this type product . 
we have used it every day for a month . 
would recommend it to anyone who s a user of ram mount products . 
upon switching to the iphone num_extend it has continued to work . 
the curved shape of the premier is the shape of this little processor . 
the plastic will have some staining over time but doesn t effect the use of the product . 
many have complained about the lid or the product being thin and easily breakable . 
wow ,  i was so wrong ! the popcorn maker comes in num_num simple to assemble parts and then the cardboard concentrator . 
i do hand wash ,  immediately after use and then dry . 
i was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived and did indeed have a brushed finish . 
i assure you that the product is as good as these reviews claim . 
the pots has a nice weight to them . 
the discovery num_num seemed to fit the bill . 
i was so happy i bought the regular jar sealer also . 
it is just so much nicer to be able to grind spices with one hand . 
works effortlessly to make smooth ,  thin sheets of pasta . 
this is a must have for the phones . 
as many folks out there ,  including anthony bourdain i too was scared of pressure cookers . 
no soap or abrasive cleaners of any kind . 
so when i saw this num_num on sale ,  i thought i was upgrading . 
i m glad when i did ,  i chose a boos . 
it fits all jars perfectly and cans well . 
protects my phone and it s simple to put on and take off . 
i bought the bodum because i like the looks better and it costs less . 
saves time ,  space and just plain awesome for those of us that can . 
so i decided to get myself a second one . 
extremely well made with every size imaginable in a handly storage tin for a very reasonable price . 
the challenge for me was making the drink hot enough . 
much cheaper than the apple version and works just as well . 
this fit his phone perfectly !  both of us are pleased with the purchase . 
i owned the old version of this same brand and model which served me well for num_extend years . 
cant wear it on my ears with my glasses without adjusting it some since thats uncomfortable . 
you just cut lemon in half ,  and press it on the top of the juicer . 
haven t dropped it yet ,  so hopefully it will hold up . 
i like the vocalyst service as well ,  even though i don t use it often . 
i have the time and the inclination to can again . 
the shipment was recieved on time ,  it worked for blackberry num_num car charger . 
i love that i can take it from vehicle to vehicle with me . 
it is very easy to use and has all the necessary things to make it a very handy product . 
i am happy with the order and you will be too . 
i asked for this for christmas so i could make tea at my desk at work . 
the lip on the top makes for pain free pressing for continued use . 
these are the best forks i have ever found for crab legs . 
we have num_num of these pots at church . 
it is great for traveling and using the map app . 
i have bought a couple as gifts and always have a replacement on hand . 
i did and this was the closest to my old one . 
as always with cuisinart ,  quality goods !  grinds the beans quickly and easy to clean . 
i have thrown out many others ,  i always have two on hand . 
the soft plastic lid seals tight enough to use it as a shaker . 
i got this originally for under $  used   came sealed in it s package ,  though  . 
but .  .  .  . now i am getting a new one . i have had this product for about a year and a half . 
this counter undercount is awesome and i have more counter room . 
i ve called ,  but haven t reached a clueful cingular support rep yet . 
we have had these same shears for years . 
i would never have thought i would switch brands but so far ,  so good with the kitchen aid . 
really liked how grippy the sides of the phone are . 
i normally go though cases in a few months . 
recommended for people who cook small to medium amounts of rice at least two times a week . 
each glass size ended being exactly what i like . 
great versatility with the usb port that could charge any device . 
over num_num years ago i used a pressure cooker on a regular basis . 
they are to the t and if followed the likelyhood of messing up is slim . 
i use this in between with just hot water . 
get it hot ,  just be fore it starts to smoke ,  add your rice . 
thanks to the seller for sending me a quality  new  product . 
it is clean and it locks  the lock is a little tricky to work  . 
they re made of glass so they behave more like pyrex in the microwave . 
nice design ,  easy to assemble and decent quality . 
about this product because of the low price . 
i am hoping it will last her through several years ,  but we will have to wait and see . 
the num_num cup capacity has always been more than enough for my family of three as well . 
i got this phone num_num weeks after its launch mid june num_extend using it daily ,  and just about every feature . 
i ve heard they are great with repairs if you need one . 
it won t wreck it .   this thing cooks everything we ve thrown in it perfectly . 
the only thing better would have been getting a new mixer . 
however ,  i have become used to the screen appearance and like the way that this protector works . 
to be honest ,  i m pretty neutral about these . 
even if you only use it to dice garlic ,  it is worth owning . 
this is a very nice pepper grinder in a sea of junk grinders . 
it works great for reheating soup or making instant oatmeal . 
and is the best quality cast iron cookware made . 
great coffee maker and very easy to use . 
this cup set lets you see the size with ease thanks to the larger number on the handle !  . 
it s actually num_num cents cheaper now in num_num than it was when i bought it in num_extend
first i like that the whole chassis is stainless steel . 
practical and ingenious ,  we use it all the time . 
this one is ,  but it ll wear away the nonstick properties faster ,  so handwashing is recommended . 
i love cast iron and this is my go to pot for baking my crusty bread . 
it s much cheaper to buy your first items in a kit ,  rather than individually . 
the size of the pan was perfect ,  and i was also pleased with the roasting rack included . 
it recharges quickly and i make sure it s always ready to go . 
these arrived and are a little short but they work perfectly . 
it was very helpful to have the number of cups needed for each pan plainly described on the packaging . 
these make nice gifts that won t break the bank . 
keep in mind that it is slow so plan on charging overnight with it . 
i will not have my iphone until april . 
after several drops the case has yet to come flying off as many of the hard cases do . 
i won t take a star away just for preference . 
i own several timers and this is my favorite . 
works perfectly and much better than non htc charger on my hct phone . 
the audio is great and people never complain about not hearing me . 
excellent num_extend stars instead of num_num because of the price . 
it s also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries . 
this is one that the quality was just as sweet as the quantity . 
we all can use one charger instead of having multiple chargers all over the place . 
i bought this for my motorola droid num_extend
i like the dual plug in style on the charger that includes usb access . 
it turns out that making yogurt is easy; just follow the included directions . 
everyone loves this juicer ,  and they are easy to use and clean . 
that s just the nature of cast iron cookware . 
the disposal cup is large enough and easy to empty and reinstall on the vacuum . 
it has never failed to open what i needed opened . 
i recommend them to anyone needing great value for the money . 
i bought this otterbox case because the defender is too bulky . 
i bought this because it happened to be top rated based off a youtube video i saw . 
all of my reviews on the chicago metallic bakeware are going to look much the same . 
and the steel just didn t conduct the heat to my satisfaction . 
it took num_num hours to bring it to full charge . the ipad num_num was at num_num percent capacity . 
otherwise i can find no fault with the cup . 
i do have a few scratches on the protector screen ,  but that s what its there for . 
zucchini ,  cucumbers ,  cabbage ,  sweet potatoes ,  etc you can t feed faster the chute faster than this machine can work . 
this is compact ,  and does a good job of grinding . 
i bought these gloves so that i could use an iphone when it s cold . 
this was a cheap solution to my problem . 
arrived undamaged and no broken wire like other reviewers stated . 
love it ! we ve used it to grind from french press to cappuccino ,  without a hitch . 
it is principally the same machine reguardless of who s name is on it . 
i use it mainly for preparing coffee beans for storage . 
you should quickly learn to get used to not putting the heat so high with these pans . 
i have used this while sitting in a deer stand charging num_num iphones . 
this shaker is all glass and stainless steel . 
it replaces parchment paper and it is washable and reusable . 
when i came to get one for the florida place ,  this was the one i needed . 
it pulls a beautiful shot ,  and i love having so much control over each shot . 
don t let the rest of the pot sit on the burner and then throw it away . 
within a year the plastic tube on the shredding disk began to break . 
my old krups made great ,  hot coffee; i was hoping the cuisinart would also . 
yes it s a pain ,  but this is what s necessary when you must always be connected . 
if you wear glasses like me you want high end quality sound and mic then this is your headset . 
it reminds me of my grandma and my childhood days on the farm . 
the amazon description says this charger is rated for num_extend but the label on the charger says num_extend
i had ozarka deliver water to my family and it was getting to expensive . 
i m not very good at these things so i m sure others who are handy had a much easier time . 
access to the volume and power buttons is not at all obstructed . 
also ,  they re not quite as large or easy to load as my canvas bag . 
after all ,  it is the kettle that could perform on all the necessary levels . 
it works amazingly and stands up to a lot of abuse . 
two minutes in my microwave and i have a big bowl of popcorn . 
i bought this item to listen to much while i ran . 
i did use the bare floor attachment and actually prefer to clean the bare floors not using it . 
it cooks everything evenly and it gets that perfectly done color . 
noisy ,  but not as bad as some . overall :  well built and a great product for the money . 
that stand is locked in there quite well . 
but the cut of the blade was impressive !  a good buy especially for as much as we use it . 
so there s a guessing game in that regard as well .   . 
they really don t get a lot of use because they re just a little too small . 
for normal phone tasks ,  the boxwave works great . 
i have been frustrated with the treo num_extend because of its low quality external speaker . 
i just wish acrylic had a few more products along this line . 
isn t that the ultimate goal ?  ?  ?  this is the bluetooth headset that you need to buy !  . 
love all the color cases for such a cheap price . 
they work great drowning out all the noise while i am working out !  would buy them again . 
i can pop it off and clean it easily . 
over time i ve become a fan of oxo products . 
i put any delicate items that need to be washed . 
once that s been taken care of though ,  this thing really cooks . 
the result ,  i m not wasting gallons of water . 
now my phone will last for a while when i am traveling . 
if you are a good cook ,  i d be willing to bet you ll love this pan ,  too . 
in addition to the clip ,  there is an additional loop that can be snapped around your belt . 
two pulses in one direction and one or two in the other direction gets most of the jobs done . 
i love the big round cookies it makes also ,  they come out in perfect uniform size every time . 
this product is awesome !  the previous reviews about the sturdiness of this product ,  i found was very wrong . 
this device does both of those actions quickly . 
you really can t go wrong for this price . 
had no problem with air bubbles when applying ,  removed the few dust particles with tape . 
on my ipad num_extend series ,  it has actually charged my ipad faster than plugging it into the wall . 
i purchased the lenox  holiday nouveau  num_extend round tablecloth to coordinate with several lenox holiday nouveau serving pieces . 
i have three teenage boys who eat a lot and we tend to cook large meals . 
this is great to have on hand and a fun thing to do with kids or grandchildren . 
this is exactly the same as the one it replaced and works perfectly . 
much more workable for me in our apartment than an outdoor barbeque . 
my iphone num_extend connected instantly the first time i turned this on . 
although this case is called  rubberized ,   it more of a hard plastic case with a soft surface feel . 
it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine . 
thanks amazon and the manufacturer for good packing and quick shipping . 
charges quickly  but since it s going to be there while you re asleep ,  speed shouldn t matter too much  . 
on it s high heat setting ,  it uses only num_num watts . 
as long as you have a microwave ,  you ll need one of these . 
this butter dish easily stores a standard sized quarter pound stick of butter with room to spare . 
this cord has been put through the wringer with my iphone num_num and it still works num_extend years later . 
i believe the free rpm is about num_num and num_num amps on the xt . 
at the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting . 
the resultant edges are smooth enough not to easily cut you . 
 backlight would make it perfect  .  .  .  .  . sound quality is pretty good ,  though not great . 
calphalon has become my favorite brand of cookware . 
the lg optimus v  part of the one series  is an excellent starter phone for android . 
overall ,  i got exactely what i expected which is perfect . 
i searched long and hard to find a quality charger for my phone . 
the space bag does take some effort to use since you have to roll the air out . 
ok ,  this is like the third time i have rated this . 
it s effective  clear  range is appx num_num feet . 
it does an excellent job for a hand sharpener ,  and it is very convenient to carry . 
as time goes on ,  i see num_num circles of dust showing up on the tulle . 
these were significantly cheaper than the cast aluminum pan . 
who ever designed this did a bang up job a good looking sleek design and looks futheristic . 
i like being able to attach it to my belt or just hang it on my pants pocket . 
i love my knives and this is fast becoming a favorite . 
this pan is the perfect size for my household . 
it is protective too !  when mine wears out if it does  i will buy another !  . 
this makes that particular part difficult to clean . 
the grease channel has to be dumped ,  kind of messey with a hot griddle . 
my experience with steak has not been good and i need to experiment more . 
no damages to it and no fading color after my extensive use and changes . 
the first is a two piece hard shell that snaps around the ipod . 
the can opener ,  also cuts down on effort . 
you can use itunes or windows media to sort of organize your stuff on the phone itself . 
this would be good for a single person ,  college student ,  or small family . 
otherwise this works amazingly well in a variety of different sized pots . 
they are good looking ,  not cheap or flimsy ,  and the mill works perfectly . 
plastic very sturdy and holds up well to the microwave heat . 
we have the older model of these delonghi radiator heaters from a relative . 
it hugs the phone tight enough that many people won t know you have a case on it . 
i also found that it had a pretty long battery life . 
i store this item in the freezer with the attachments so its ready to go when i am . 
i am using a rooted and modded inspire num_extend
the sound quality is awesome for me and callers ,  some say too good . 
he tells me it is by far the best one he has ever used . 
we totally love its versibility to mount is various areas . 
i suggest you give it as a gift . 
i bought this springform pan based on the recommendation of several trusted sources ,  including cook s illustrated magazine . 
this kitchenaid unit was purchased to make ice cream . 
it s easy to keep the set shiny if you use the steel wool soap pads once a while . 
it is so thin and light you barely realize it s on the phone . 
probably should not have purchased as fried foods are not good for you but they taste good . 
haha .  . trust me i learned from experience . i was a blackberry user for years ,  and i never wanted to switch . 
i use them for my fish tanks with my salts ,  buffers and chemicals . 
in that time ,  i ve managed to drop my phone several times . 
i love this blue tooth !  i ve had several over the years and i finally decided o try again . 
the cable the samsung facinate comes with allways came loose . 
the size is nice ,  comes with cables and adapters or just use your current usb cable . 
i use to make my tea in big quantities since i drank so much . 
handles are actually a bit longer than the blade but that is the novelty . 
those types of microphones are great for popstars ,  but i prefer a headset that is a little less noticeable . 
i needed something unbreakable for my daughter s bathroom ,  but also wanted something reasonably attractive and this fit the bill . 
it is secure enough that i could probably go jogging with it and not fall out . 
i have another set from different brand but these are my favorites . 
we cook hamburgers ,  steaks ,  hot sandwiches ,  the possibilites are nearly endless . 
i do agree with the other statements about the container being a bit on the cheap side . 
they are great for placing baking goods on when they come out of the oven . 
depending on what you use them for ,  they should last for many years . 
i foresee the vacuum being released like the other reviewers mentioned . 
a little more work to clean up after . 
i have a  yuck  glass top stove and need to make bone broth on a regular basis . 
i attempted the electrical tape fix i ve seen on youtube ,  but it did not work . 
also ,  a little indicator will come on saying  time s up  ,  and the counter start to count up . 
i have owned my machne for over a decade and haven t had the slightest problem with it . 
i d had non stick fry pans up until now ,  they worked fine ,  nothing wrong with them . 
i m hoping it does not develop a rust issue ,  who knows . 
this is probably the best bb for the money . 
much better price than williams sonoma and other high end cooking shops . 
due to this efficiency ,  it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat . 
i took my standard bundt cake recipe and cut it in half ,  and it was perfect for this pan . 
this juicer is a monster ,  it will juice anything you through down the tube . 
i have two small children ,  perhaps enough said but . 
keep charged batteries for spares when your battery goes dead . 
i really enjoy these with my wok cooking . 
this is a plastic shamppoer and the pieces dont install well . 
use small amounts and use the shake method after salting . 
i hang the from a hook in the kitchen . 
as mentioned ,  the mesh is fine enough that only the tiniest tea leaf particles get through . 
it keeps you connected in your vehicle and with it you really are on the go !  . 
it is a very sturdy batter bowl and it will last years to come . 
because of my mistake ,  the dough rose too much and eventually collapsed on itself . 
if you use just a coffee cup or mug ,  be sure not to overfill the reservoir . 
i am going to try and interrupt the cycle to make pizza dough . 
another plus is that it is reasonably light for its size . 
the icarrier is another well built battery by them . 
very nice sauce pan i used yesterday all the long and it was easy to clean . 
it took me a few applications before i got good at it . 
for the price ,  i doubt you can find a better carving knife . 
when juicing ,  the motor is loud ,  but seems a lot quieter than other juicers i ve heard . 
i put this in a upstairs room to circulate the air up there . 
rezound  ,  the thunderbolt s screen is noticeably wider and negligibly shorter . 
riveted handles are exceptionally strong ,  but make the pot a bit harder to clean . 
it has increased my water intake easily a hundred fold . 
but i have other spatulas for when i need a straight edge . 
i always clean it after using and add a layer of cooking oil to keep it nice . 
no worries there !  my phone and ipod were taken care of thanks to this battery . 
this headset was purchased to replace a jabra num_extend
so ,  he started using on grill at home and had to purchase another for glamping . 
con :  nonepro :  it contains a sturdy yet beautiful cutting board . 
it is beautiful with a smooth ,  shiny finish . 
well worth the money ,  and perhaps nail polish could replace the markings that wear off ?  . 
i had ordered two swatters because a friend had complained about his old swatter . 
coffee had to change the design of the tea maker and the new pitchers are squatter . 
i bought one of these mixers several months ago and have used it extensively . 
we have been using it for almost num_num years ,  with sharpening in between . 
the phone began to freeze on phone calls and camera gallery . 
the num_extend uses a regular sim so swapping this sim isn t possible without this adapter . 
it is very nice comes with a car charger and an aux . 
i ve only done one cake in it so far ,  but had no problems with it sticking or cooking unevenly . 
i love this !  i was a little upset that when i received it ,  it was broken . 
the same goes for beef and pork roasts . 
if you like guacomole or margaritas .  .  . this is for you . 
i use it when i clean the outside refrig . 
i expect to use these dishes for the rest of my life . 
this is my third attempt at a thermal carafe . 
i m amazed that i never get any unpopped kernels ,  as i did with microwave bags . 
i use this vent mount with my samsung galaxy nexus and my ipod . 
i had to season the press ,  but that was easy . 
the plantronics  . audio num_num usb stereo headset is good quality for a compact headset . 
with the glass lid i can see if the liquid is all absorbed with out letting the steam out . 
i can still connect power cord at bottom and speaker cable at top fine . 
we also used it in our barbecue and surprise it worked great ,  so so easy to clean . 
if you are in need of one ,  this would be a good choice . 
it can also be pressed into service as a last line of defense . 
i bought this toaster about a month ago and i am very pleased with it . 
like i said ,  it is not really steam . 
more important ,  she speaks clearly and eloquently ,  pronouncing names with a natural voice . 
then i made a cup where i tightly tamped my espresso ground coffee into the filter container . 
this will clean out the intake tube and prevent the dribbling as the num_num star poster mentioned . 
it is very sharp ad makes peeling very easy . 
it gives a little extra room to work ,  and fits nicely on my oven rack . 
keep the phone clean and had no problem with it . 
my num_extend fits perfectly with the protective skin on it . 
i bought it because it is the meat pounder alton brown recommended . 
the domed lid is perfect to keep things from splattering . 
i use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control . 
i am very happy with my purchase and highly suggest it to anyone who needs a mixer . 
i have purchased other soup mugs ,  but this is the one for me . 
this machine works well for me and is a breeze to clean . 
i just wipe them off with a damp cloth to clean . 
some people bash the back battery cover which is a thin plastic cover . 
i recommend it to all of my friends that have carpet . 
volume buttons are a little hard to get to but not to bad . 
this slicer is so sharp and very easy to use for my tendinitis wrist . 
wow ,  for the price it s a really good cable . 
these are great screen protecters and look very nice . 
typical that something so good and so long lasting ,  is not available any longer . 
these kitchen shears rock and are in heavy rotation in my kitchen . 
we re impressed with this line and are likely to buy more . 
these classic knifes are exactly what i expected . 
bench press ,  sit ups ,  etc .   these sets would be perfect . 
i don t have that fear with the vent mounting . 
update :  obviously i caved in and got the num_extend anyway . 
a good cell phone ,  but absolutely no peripheral features .  . the good :  very clear voice qualities ,  acceptable speaker phone function . 
i have purchased glass lids for many of my pots ,  etc . 
i discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged . 
the glass protectors are catching on ,  check one out . 
and they were all cheeply made and they could not afford a real good made one . 
they are fabulous and indespensable if you are a cook . 
i bought this item for me ,  my grandson and yes even my cats . 
this is really a great buy for about $
after buying what seemed like every ice cream scoop on the market ,  we finally found perfection . 
they get a lot of wear ,  so i buy them two at a time . 
once you use this one you will never go back to pounding your meat with anything else . 
i had solid ones before with no rollers . 
i like to make water with fruit in it . 
whoever posted that it was too light was just trying to pull our chain . 
the discount cards for places like cvs ,  walgreens ,  etc  . 
would highly recommend for anyone wanting to grill inside . 
recommended for anyone who wants to save money . 
the handle is shorter than my regular pans ,  and the handle can get very hot during cooking . 
bought for use in making cocoa ,  french onion soup and to microwave without the handles getting hot . 
it saves trips back and forth to the kitchen if we re spending time outside . 
it keeps the square shape of the iphone without being too bulky . 
not protective only stylish but it wasnt intenedeintended to protect my case for me only for cute . 
the rolled top edge makes it easy on the hands when cutting mulitple cookies etc . 
but ,  hey what do you expect for a num_num mah beast . 
if not for this ,  i d have given it five stars . 
it s non nonstick ,  but it s not very sticky and it cleans up very easily by hand . 
so the best option is to buy the cheap cases that she can do that with . 
the long handle makes it top heavy when trying to rest it somewhere . 
there are far more positive reviews than negative reviews !  . 
thanks so very much for an awesome case . 
other than that ,  this vacuum is great for apartment dwellers and people who live in small living places . 
it dust doesn t have the width to turn those bigger items well . 
i cut up a ziploc bag and used it for the bottom and top and pressed another tortilla out . 
i am very picky about my morning coffee and am willing to pay to have a quality machine . 
this pressure cooker is a welcome addition to my kitchen . 
there are also belt loops but i have not used them yet . 
if you make big batches ,  get a big cuisinart . 
i can t wait to get home and try the bagel dough recipe . 
makes a good cup of coffee and does it reasonably quickly . 
it fits perfectly and i like how it is hugs my phone . 
i like the design too ,  so i have enjoyed drinking out of them . 
great buy !  i love to decorate my bb . 
this one will be coming out much more frequently . 
the smaller plates are great for toast in the mornings . 
we were so happy that amazon carried this . 
when i told them the bargain ,  they asked me to order for them . 
hope this helps someone get a better idea of the product . 
i bought this as my wife has developed a taste for guacamole dip . 
i don t cut raw meat on the boards ,  and ocassionally ,  i wash my boards in a little bleach water . 
it hasn t really proved problematic ,  as the touch response doesn t seem to be affected ,  but it s a little awkward . 
if you put it back on your warm stove ,  it helps dry it more quickly . 
thinking of ordering some as gifts for my friends who also have iphones . 
not really enough to leave a huge residue but a puff . 
it s a great product for a great price !  !  !  cant beat it !  !  !  . 
easy install ,  hold great on bumpy roads and i havent had any noises or vibrations . 
glass is thick and durable and fits nicely in the wire frame . 
it was the correct item and was delivered within num_num days of order being placed . 
very good price also as the same item at verizon costs almost num_extend
it s a phone charger for the motorola razor ,  and guess what ?  it works for it . 
i hear it works well ,  but i don t have the experience myself ,  therefore i can t give first hand experience . 
i unscrewed the fuse cap to reveal a tiny glass type fuse . 
they wash up easily ,  and the plastic container is perfect for storage . 
this one is so much better than the cheap types i ve subjected myself to in the past . 
a plastic blade guard would be a nice addition . 
couldnt be that much harder to add it . 
cheaper then what s in the store ,  and seems to be working fine . 
bought these to fight the glare from lights and being outside . 
i am very hard on my dishes and have been using corelle for years because of it . 
took me two tries but they work nicely . 
plus i ve found it to be very accurate . 
just this one product and cakes and breads pop out of their pan perfectly . 
my fiancee picked it out and she loves it . 
use plastic wrap or simple napkin over them and no problems . 
bought as a gift after having the griffin num_extend amps car charger . 
it s pretty thin so just take care of it . 
but back to the stand mixer ,  it is worth every penny for this kitchenaid . 
now that i have them all back ,  i m good to go !  . 
i will keep an eye out for more to add to my collection . 
i keep one in the car and others in the charging drawer at the house . 
this is as good as you can get for a dollar less screen protector . 
they clean up in the dishwasher easily too . 
i bought a different brand . i have owned this model for several years . 
thanks to amazon ,  i can find a replacement at any time of the year . 
very happy with this new addition to my kitchen . 
it doesn t plug directly into the iphone so you will need to also carry a charging cord . 
it worked great in my car and charged my phone quickly . 
these were ok ,  didn t like real small ones . 
it s easy to install due to the slight stretch in the plastic . 
how i don t know . first i sent an email to sf planet via amazon . com . 
have used filter pitchers and this is much easier to use . 
my next test is going to be a small pork or beef roast with baby potatoes ,  carrots and onions . 
the straight sides allow for a cake that will be even and beautiful . 
the background noise cancellation on this thing is the top of the line . 
the problem is that my family seems to go through screen protectors like candy . 
he does not run or profusely sweat in these ,  so i cannot attest to the moisture durability . 
the three wand attachments are great for their specified purposes . 
fits neatly over your appliance with smoothly contoured lines . 
my phone runs hot while charging ,  however it does charge . 
other cloths i have purchased in the past were of such low quality that they were ,  in essence ,  disposable . 
it makes a perfect cheesecake and now i m planning on ordering another one . 
all you have to to is clear the cache . 
unfortunately ,  i only have regular applecare ,  not applecare plus  plus only started recently  . 
any case with even a hint of silicone ,  makes it a difficult task to extract from my pocket . 
i am tall so i do not have the problem some other reviewers have had of seeing the gauge . 
i love cooking in my iron skillet ,  it gives a much better flavor to food . 
the day it came in i made french fries and they came out crisp and great . 
i like that the cord can be concealed in the base . 
but since i got this one ,  it s the only one i use . 
i have used two out of the three knives ,  first remember the set is under $ for the set . 
however you want to get that ,  its up to you . 
it is very sturdy and i love the idea of no gaskets to deal with . 
the footprint is almost as big as the processor ,  but it easily fits in the cabinet . 
the guard stays put for a long time . 
i was actually pretty impressed with the sound quality of these headphones . 
just wanted to say i was pleasantly surprised when i received this today . 
we looked at several of these devices to gut a pineapple . 
after years of constant use it shows no sign of dulling . 
it is so convenient we ll live with that issue . 
she says it protects her phone from being damaged if she drops it . 
i changed my kitchen to white canister ,  coffee pot ,  etc . 
a sony ericcson may be the phone for you . 
juicer looks great ,  and is very well made . 
as mentioned earlier the item arrived as stated and the price was very excellent . 
i live in an apartment and did not want the fire alarm going off . 
when i first ordered i was nervous bc this product was supposed to be compatible with iphone . 
the price of the item well surpasses any hangups one might have . 
the contents will then cool very quickly . try this bowl to cool down custard when you are filling pastries . 
this is one of those items that delivers everything it promises . 
thought enough of them that we bought another set for a gift and the friend likes them too . 
they are heavy duty and i put hot items on them with no problems . 
love this pan for cooking for a crowd or making sheet cakes . 
this steamer has two compartments which will hold enough veggies for a family of num_extend
even the flash works well and doubles nicely as a flashlight . + battery life . 
either they do not fit properly ,  or they do not last . 
this one is being used at least weekly . 
even my son who is a boy scout loves it to sharpen his scout knife . 
however ,  it is a bit difficult to clean . 
you just have to make sure you pack down the grounds lightly before brewing . 
i was a bit skeptical of the practicality of this . 
love this dinnerware ,  have had a complete set for about num_num years and they are still in great condition . 
it fits perfect over the buttons and no gaps around the edge so far . 
it fits snuggly around both the num_num and the num_extend and slides in and out of my pocket . 
make the bread crumbs for my chicken supremes or chicken kiev ?  check ,  check ,  and check . 
i m dieting so i use an airpopper a lot . 
i could drive and get coffee faster than that . 
the machine was perfect  ,  it works like a dream . 
you need to balance size ,  cost and power . 
for this and for the unmatched service i recieved  without even contacting them  ,  i would highly recommend this product . 
however ,  i m told there is significant noise at highway speed . 
the charger worked fine for a month ,  then just stopped working . 
your phone is protected without a lot of additional bulk . 
bought one for myself ,  then had to buy a second one because my girlfriend stole my first . 
this is a fine mug for teachers ,  business people etc . 
i ve used these numerous times ,  and have issues only because i m kinda tough on a phone . 
i got one of these batteries from oem planet via the amazon . com marketplace . 
the caveat is that it only works if you insert the device as shown in the photos . 
the tea is still burn your mouth hot . 
i look at my kitchen stuff almost like a pet lol . 
i like to make very large batches of soup . 
they have been dropped ,  dented and scratched and still they continue to be my favorite bowls . 
the knife blades slide in and protects the blade . 
i moved into the suburbs where the water is so much better . 
practice with it a bit though ,  it can splash out if you have an odd shaped bottle . 
works well ,  keeps things moving smoothly ,  and helps to keep clean up faster . 
i m not sure if that s my area or the phone itself . 
it is fairly fragile and can break easily ,  so use caution when handling it . 
i use it as a decoration in my kitchen because the wood is so pretty . 
it can be a bit of pain using potholders to pick them up with the eggs inside . 
i want a kitchen stocked with beautifully feeling and looking ,  plus perfectly functionally designed kitchen tools . 
it moves air quite fast for its size . 
this is an awesome product ,  if only in appearance . 
excited because the post office ,  not amazon ,  lost  or stole  my package . 
the only downfall is the distant between iphone and headset is way less than advertised . 
can t wait for mine to arrive so i could enjoy using it too . 
the price was reasonable ,  included shipping and the back arrived four days after i ordered it including a weekend . 
there is no use using the call function in anything but the quietest settings . 
we ve had this pan for a few years now . 
still ,  knowing what i know now i would purchase it again . 
this little brewer is much better for brewing my own coffee and easier to clean . 
however i wish the sides were a bit higher on the outside . 
it holds up to twelve and a half ounces ,  five ounces more than the regular hand soap dispensers . 
it is curved and it helps shape the loaf . 
i originally got this product because i wanted a stylus for my ipad to mark up documents . 
this is not just for paella and mussels . 
if you use your fido jars a lot ,  you will eventually need a pack of these . 
this product is only glass digitizer ,  not the plastic holder underneath of it . 
i would recommend this paddle to any of my friends . 
so i am experimenting with taking filling out . 
i especially love the built in strainers in the lid . 
you can never have too many usb chargers . 
the quality for the price of this pan is awesome . 
the fact that it is not non stick allows for better cooking ,  deglazing ,  carmelizing ,  searing ,  etc . 
bought a second popper recently so we could produce more perfect popcorn at once . 
if you re going to by a manual citrus juice press ,  buy this one . 
though this product lacks class it does fit its function and purpose which is for ice tea . 
i read a lot of reviews on this before i forked out the cash . 
washes reall nice in the dishwasher with no discoler attion . 
elegant enough to impress guests ,  but sturdy and functional for everyday use . 
very small footprint on the counter as well . 
however ,  the baker in the family will want a nice clean silpat for her christmas cookies . 
really nice ,  sturdy measuring cups with good grips . 
gotta love black goes with everything ,  and of course it s the only color men want to have . 
they promptly responded that it was ,  and when the battery arrived ,  it was indeed a real motorola . 
have been needing one for awhile and decided to buy this one . 
this is a very nice case  ,  it fits just right and it closes and opens nicely . 
unlocked phones  carrier unlocked  do not require  activation  and will take any gsm sim  standard size  . 
the best thing about this is that food doesn t stain the inside . 
for the average kitchen i suspect this would last a lifetime . 
this was a great replacement for our bodum french press . 
my old charger s cable was flimsy and it stopped working right when bent in a certain position . 
saves your hands from getting cut and lids dropping in your food . 
i can put salad veggies in here together and they all come out uniformly . 
anyway ,  if you need the right angle ,  then it will be a num_num star review for you . 
this extended battery was excellent ,  price and product .  .  . can t be beat . 
so in the future we will share one . 
they make the water taste much better and help rid the water of nasty things . 
what were they thinking ?  so glad i could still find the digital display foreman . 
as usual ,  take care not to slip ,  because the points are fine ,  and will easily shred flesh . 
it is sleek looking and it cleans up very well . 
using it to charge my galaxy num_extend right now . 
i was using a griffin unit that has buttons instead of motion sensing to control the iphone . 
i have a french press that i ve been using at work ,  and the coffee is delicious and consistent . 
having had cheaper large pots ,  i steered away from buying this expensive pot . 
it fell and scooped right underneath the egg . 
were it not for my glasses ,  it would be perfect . 
i purchased these form amazon in num_num and we are still using them on a daily basis . 
only thing when it gets dropped it gets a bit scratched up on the corners . 
one gratin recipe called for num_num grated potatoes . 
little by little ,  i am learning to make our food from scratch . 
these are hard to find in local stores . 
i must say that i love every one of them . 
i can t say enough good things about this great lid . 
this reduces the suction which is critical in removing as much water from the carpet as possible . 
as a household with just two people ,  i find that the medium sized loaf is perfect for us . 
i wish it would just beep until i shut it off . 
they also appear to be better made and more durable . 
i absolutely love this thing !  !  !  !  !  !  i used to have the mr . 
they are tools . we will keep mario s ,  and move biff s measuring tools to the camping supplies . 
all the rest is good . the phone is terrific as a phone . 
this extends the use and life of the board and i think it s a shame to take that away . 
my very first cup was heaven ,  i ve never experienced such a robust ,  wonderful coffee . 
but once in a while ,  a large skillet is called for ,  and this one is perfect . 
it does have the cool v handle and i look forward to many years of use . 
so i don t worry about warping or discoloration of the handle . 
and i love it !  ! is easy to use and handles big batches of anything i want to make . 
this mitt is thick enough to protect your hands but not so thick that you can t feel the handle . 
if you prefer russets ,  cut them in half or even quarters . 
i made my favorite apricot brandy pound cake in it and it has never looked or tasted so good . 
found a good price on amazon and it included free shipping ,  couldn t go wrong . 
we use this every morning making our espresso . 
is it the closest i found for fit ,  volume ,  clarity out and in etc ?  absolutely . 
you can use it to rest ,  flatbreads on it ,  too . 
this charger works well considering it is not an actually apple product . 
the color is more vibrant that the picture and makes it easy to find in my purse . 
the screen protector is a nice feature as well . no complaints !  . 
keeps food warm and i am using it regularly . 
all of my other tongs don t hold the food as well . 
does exactly what you would expect it to do . 
i gave it num_num stars because i had to return the first on . 
this pair from calphalon has good tension ,  not too tight or loose ,  and are comfortable in your hand . 
i m very excited about using this attachment with my old kitchenaid mixer that i bought back in num_extend
but as the unit bumped and moved along ,  i was quite amazed at the cleaning power of the roomba . 
lids fit perfect after several washings in the dishwasher top shelf  . 
i took a key to it and it still looks great . 
music and speech are rendered really ,  really well . 
you will ask yourself how did i ever live without this great mixer . 
i ve has the num_extend model for num_num months and it is great . 
unlike some people who use this water for only cooking purposes  , i drink this water and love it . 
the surface is  rubberized  so it won t slip in your hands . 
easy desgin ,  just slip your finger in and it slices through the peel . 
however ,  if you re in the middle of cooking something ,  this can be a quandary . 
for him ,  he gets a dessert ,  a veg ,  a salad and a main . 
riedel is one of the tests that is easy for even beginning drinkers to see the difference in . 
when you let it cool on it s own ,  that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization . 
keeps our counters looking more neat and organized . 
hard to tell ,  however ,  when measuring water or other clear liquids . 
i use it everyday and its been great . 
this headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer . 
my husband has num_num cup of french press in the mornings . 
the juice tastes delicious and the consistency is smooth with a perfect amount of juicy foam at the top . 
great for slicing where surface tension is high and inner stability threatened . 
as far as the filters on all the brands ,  they are basically charcoal based . 
having the right tools makes any task easier . 
we ve had it almost num_num months and it still works like the day we got it . 
perfect ,  well build and also perfectly fit all kinds of gismoz . 
the case sacrificed itself  the top corner cracked  but i d rather replace a num_extend case over a num_extend iphone . 
this juicer does a good job making this drink which i really can t make in the vitamix . 
i cconsidered replacing it with the bosch universal plus but instead went with this kitchenaid pro num_extend
great cookware . you can keep a pot of chili or pasta sauce simmering without scorching for hours . 
ok ,  i m with everybody when it comes to this tray . 
it heats fast and is very efficient in heating . 
to be fair ,  i ve only tried a couple of bluetooth headsets ,  but this is definitely not a disappointment . 
they work great and especially for frying chicken to searing steaks . 
thank goodness for amazon !  i found the exact match . 
we got this after our old beater began to flake off . 
the stones were easy to heat in the microwave ,  and they held heat through dinner . 
besides that it has been a great case . 
a finer grind coffee will give you major flavor without having to use so much i found . 
considering the above ,  it s well worth this price . 
she loves the shade of yellow and says it is a perfect addition to her other fiesta sets . 
bought these because of plans to take cakes to fund raisers . 
this cover fits it nicely and together they do make a statement of color . 
all you have to do is pulse the food chopper until the desired size is attained . 
not too big or too small but just right . 
normally i m partial to the oxo stuff ,  but this juice press is miles better . 
it s cleared up a lot of space in my pantry and made getting to my spices much handier . 
i use them for fruit ,  mixing ,  even togo food that needs a bowl like pho ,  curry ,  etc . 
only issue is when you first put them on you have to have patience and a steady hand . 
every thing comes with it that is needed to hang it on the wall . 
i think they ll last as long as i want them around . 
and the retractable cord is also a very nice feature . 
never have found anything as good at this as these bamboo brushes .  .  .  !  . 
the unit size is nice and there is room to fry a lot of potatoes . 
we are back to buy another cordless vacuum . 
but you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to . 
it looks as good as it did when i first got it . 
great for slow cooking baby food and for dips at a great price . 
love this knife ,  a definite go to staple piece in my kitchen . 
the handle feels a little plasticky ,  and less grippy or weighted than expected . 
it s the perfect size ,  does what it needs to ,  was a good price for what i wanted . 
i wish i would have had this when i was single . 
they seem to be pretty accurate and durable as well . 
i cant believe how much hair and dust it picked up . 
bought this for my mother when her old bunn coffee maker wouldn t quit leaking . 
but i can t say that i really like popcorn without that butter . 
i thought it would dull easily or wear down ,  after all it s only $ but i was wrong . 
air vents like the ones in some of the other review pics are the ones it works with . 
it definitely takes more effort to press the button ,  but it is by no means impossible or even difficult . 
it s great because of it s heavy duty material . 
it looks good doing it too ,  though that s frankly not a consideration . 
everyone heard me clearly and i heard them clearly . 
the inside lid of the door pops off for quick cleaning , revealing the inner surface of the door with gaskets . 
the batter was so thick i had to spoon it under the support bars . 
the cradle is snapped onto the mount and is ready for use . 
work well as a serving bowl or as a soup bowl . 
i did not bother reading the directions ,  and was able to set it up easily . 
however ,  it over heats if i use it to long without a break . 
the padding is a nice touch and there is no sag in it when its hanging from the vent . 
this is a terrific item if your washer is not right near your dryer . 
the parts were perfect and fit together easily . 
i just received the num_extend screen protector and i would definitely say that it is made of good quality . 
they clean easy ,  lightweight and take no space to store upright . 
it says to replace in num_num months ,  but actually you should base this time on the rate of use . 
i used num_num grams of flour to num_num eggs for my pasta dough . 
but i wasn t that impressed with it after my first use .
