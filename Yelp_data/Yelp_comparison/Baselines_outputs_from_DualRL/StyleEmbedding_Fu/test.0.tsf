i carne asada does made every only it just the prices are get mediocre stuff .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
so basically tasted watered down .
she said she 'd be back and instead a long $ _num_ .
i ca n't read , all rate ? ) .
just left and took it off the bill .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the customers .
but it probably sucks too !
we sit down and we got some really slow and prices suck .
the charge did barely people crab and a deli first .
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were a ask future .
the cash register area was empty and no one was on las town phoenix .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
filthy , on my office clearly that understand really customer service .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crisp .
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with sauce .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
the store is bought , the building does n't deal .
there was only meat and bread .
when i visited in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
she was not happy being there .
free today for the price and me were extremely management right .
the associates section is no longer an option .
the decor was seriously lacking .
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
the sales people here are terrible .
salsa is not hot or good .
so i asked for the card to be replaced .
i just received a serving ever start and when my save try about .
i was n't going to let her do my husband in sure to my hours .
all she did it said my return for care and that feels tasted doctor .
the beans were in the cajun was the sauce what good in a bland .
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
we 've sent tables run there ladies make me that can kind of happy .
always rude in their sauce very quiet on actually attitude customer !
they really need to work on their customer service and average situation .
i all job when 's very go to the beer .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
when i first came to town ... crispy is give a a down .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
i asked for breakfast light and got very little spice .
i was very sick the night after .
i left hungry and ghetto down is closed .
i just left this car wash and was very satisfied !
had one mediocre meal and said , one does n't time you would .
the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
i guess she was n't happy that we were n't more service .
the only saving rip was my baked cheese .
lost a long time customer !
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
i was also where a oil but he tonight over have $ _num_ .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
my groupon is only for the two windows .
church section only doing my waste time and & a beautiful diner and easy .
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
we will not be using this location again .
this is a horrible venue .
you 'll have awful employee after the first bite .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
owner : a very rude man .
this place is a terrible place to live !
stopped by for soda while on being in fine past next time .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
it looks like mashed people put the office a good in behind chinese issue .
what about the time i wasted ?
there are better happy hours as comfort prices dinner at pittsburgh !
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
doughnuts place : 'll i look like the shady job place .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
not even real brown sauce .
i will not those business is a as a beautiful with sense to play .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
his offer of a `` free maintenance had it even , tasteless .
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
overall it was a miserable evening .
the woman did n't even apologize .
i expected so nice me mention , this is slow and this was .
zero complaints with his work .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
the espresso was way too hot .
i know i should have sent this back sandwich to fixed .
they wo n't tell you though .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
provided the valley is and not so amazing .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
i wo n't be ordering again .
let me give my opinion , that 's what it 's morning .
she did not apologize or anything .
prices are just plain store .
but this place was not relatively disappointed the is a problem .
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
who knows , it might have been .
the beer sauce is so-so at best .
the building was and truly uncomfortable .
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
if i could give zero stars we found there place !
only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .
no call , no nothing .
i wish i could give less than one star .
the wonton was seriously lacking filling .
if i could give less stars , i would .
she could not and would not answer serving .
think twice -- this place is a dump .
i 'm not one of the corn people .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
even if i was exceptionally enough if she came that it come food .
as an arizona happy of she have to be one for a saturday .
i got there , was seated pretty forever and food and both had perfection .
so , no treatment and no contact to more me with my clothes as !
at this location the service was terrible .
so who do i call to get my money back .
overcooked so tough she was it and a lack rolls , the shrimp .
i 'm standing in a baby so this would have .
service was a little slow to begin with .
thanks instead the great process serving put for with him a slow lack of glass .
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
i hate to see what their delivery times and team when what it visit .
just went back to get the guest on customers and filled .
i expected so much better from this indian and book .
i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .
the food is worse than you find in the lights at section .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
the security pressure are the building with on the onion pm to have back seated .
i wanted to like this place but they are just real bad a waiter .
i did n't know woman we 've nails came care , .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
they make a bad name for used car whatsoever .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
just a frozen women cooked like a home one .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
this is the worst chain menu spot on years at any of them .
the new management team is horrible !
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
they also have lost a guy this customer and live service selection .
the evening started out slow .
i imagine , that then eat 's so do a worst .
the queen bed was horrible !
um i 'm waiting for an answer .
oh , i should not have asked .
my sister all such mediocre and the next portion the while !
this place is just ok .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
this is the reason i will never go back .
careful is , it is no table and garden on flavor .
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and broken !
the office also failed to even apologize about it lack bar life .
nope , way way worse .
there are no smiles and no customer service .
when she did n't answer him too low or were all after helped me .
the fried rice was gross and there was a disappointment in flavor .
if your patio is south , welcomed after home on weeks .
plus the shuttle did n't even know how to us the food .
overall : lost my business building for a fun better style ( amazing % .
it was so odd , i asked her while it looked like she !
the food was mediocre at best , far done well and not cooked and strong .
food was cold ( still frozen , i was some had it .
was n't busy , no apologies .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
this room that he found also hole my table !
also , the food that is there is n't great to look room !
so i brought my business elsewhere .
professionals are five because _num_ services delicious unit .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
it shows because on a saturday night there was a to pay dinner .
alfredo sauce has good back as the city you was .
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
i will never visit the salon again .
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
i would n't go back there again .
this was by far the rest and the time & annoyed .
the rest of their food is sorry and generous soup and friendly service .
as for the food , never had it .
however , the tech said nothing to me about this .
i 'm from the rib when i pork inside for the cold atmosphere with either .
my mom ordered the breakfast salmon meal with it 's everything was free .
i ordered garlic bread and broccoli gives lettuce staff at perfection .
it does not take that long to cook tips !
the sandwich was not that great .
the man did not stop her .
nope ... we did just found anything did what down on to do .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
food was alright maybe we should have had a bread down the margarita .
beware but not of course lots of lobster was eating store .
it shows that this restaurant has no class .
an simple while we gave me one they and get n't care .
we 've been to this long apartment and friday many times .
my bowl i started no tables , under couple of you went at ton .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
we gave it another daughters '' by it kidding a service and left .
even the ice cream was very friendly , to near ice months .
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink dollars for hours .
as soon as they delivered i am was good .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
just terrible is all i can say .
did they have not a date is on the afternoon ?
his egg dishes would even eat are and smell !
stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .
we stood there in many guy '' too this never what .
i 've eaten here many years , but so bland as sit time experience .
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
however , everyone could my buy has almost brought orders .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the experience her .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very thorough .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
is zero stars an option ?
i live around , hard if they are nothing better to henderson .
but let this story begin at lunch there .
seriously though , i have never lived here .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
but their personality was clueless !
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili sweet sauce was they and cheese .
so he can charge a friend -- drive to .
were we arrive all or something ?
this place has pissed me off for the last time .
do not sign a sister with these people .
do n't waste the trip .
had to returned one entree because too cold .
the restroom was a mess .
i mean that 's been my experience !
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
either way i would never recommend buying from greatest and ever .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
its also not a very clean park .
i tried to call stood with no response .
they charged me for work not done , and done that fixed .
it looks old and outdated .
he did not return my call either .
if you return tried the smile would be back is or .
i would rather wait for waitress friendly restaurant the desserts and dry and correct .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
this one is not on the ball .
for the rating and i 've been a management since anything too !
the refill is problem 's an issue either .
very crowded , difficult to have a chance i have been put something time .
i think it 's terrible services desk staff leave expensive .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
french toast plate was good , mom , said but eggs and thin .
now the food : not horrible , but below average .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
no stars is what in want to give .
when it came we should have sent it back .
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
this place type and been attention for the best great time !
bottom line they up but all and thorough .
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
nothing that special about this place .
smoking are always out while !
management no longer cares about the golf experience .
complaints a workers at sushi i am in the only the everyone for the entire .
my corn was served ... n't and meatballs look flavor .
found the place even though it is no hard run right ?
not sure and i do n't care !
two hours of my life i can never get back .
dropped off my servers annoyed of pepper three mexican of pictures .
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
service fair , glasses was the building , each restaurant - .
second time , not so good .
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
what the hell are you doing ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and that was tastes salty .
i checked online , and the coupon tastes of the managers have were .
refill , but great experience without win .
parking : no holes or that happy i just ask on the best .
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .
not so great food and service .
this is an old worn out hotel .
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
the chairs are for warm as usual .
this place is beyond a shit hole .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
went back in for reasons , called it n't .
service was just as disappointing .
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
the only thing i was offered was a free dinner ?
management does not seem to care .
i had a horrible experience , and but i should not go back .
it is not really brown rice .
did n't even get a response .
needless to say , i bought point this bread where we checked by .
my wife came in for standards are tiny by so have .
i ordered a salad with the food with ice that part .
had it not been so somewhat poor and it would have been sat it .
she did offer me a week say and went out of the line lady .
i listened to let them know but they apparently dont care .
i figured we hate a front where her greek was and .
it did n't get finished .
we will not be coming back .
he could n't actually read her cards , though .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
ate paint , smoke , , not so much .
even the water tasted horrible .
and the food is simply not as good as the other star .
sounds good does n't it ?
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
yes , the portions were large , but size is the homemade '' .
it was over fried and very hard .
i have not received such an attitude for my old anyone .
the overall prices are not healthy and friend .
too bad it was at the type of it the other customers .
we 'll see if being though , i am not beat all the .
and management does n't do anything about it .
no wonder these restaurants are myself high at our second visit .
what were you going to charge me when i sit in the seafood !
i 'm still craving my clam noodles !
these days the quality is pretty lousy .
this woman should not be in the service was open of all attitude .
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
my husband had to walk up to the bar and a great order was delicious .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite amazing .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
this place is dirty and run down and the service everywhere !
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
so , it went in the trash .
it was paying people by incredible , , not do that had sent this place .
so i ordered my guests went charge , a few min for a baby .
kudos about i do n't take any bed tables with me .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than miserable .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
talk about beware professionalism went they 'll run these !
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
but the customer service once the pathetic for me .
i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
i was very disappointed with this place .
so you are n't my problem . ''
unfortunately , the tour crew and definitely suck .
ca n't outside recommend a places to dessert - real yet .
she does n't say that they smells at _num_ .
the others ordered the road curry stuff was funny , delicious and correct .
the staff was standing to be found .
it tasted like helping rice with actually anything which end good .
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
i before almost fact 's go & to pay care of the bill .
save your money & your eyes .
what a waste of my time and yum .
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife was enough .
my fault for not looking more , it like this issue .
the server was n't buying .
worst customer service i have ever had .
sad what has never to this sandwich shop .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
this branch is getting worse and worse .
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
they can thank you for the couple .
i did n't even eat it .
this was the first time i ever contacted from a haircut .
there was no personality to our server .
if i was n't with my fianc and i would check out .
i did n't know jack was a chain .
i 'm sure they must get it quickly quite tip this more customers there .
went to the sunday for our birthday to keep fried corporate late .
this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
the game room is a waste of time , nicely of noodles .
i also told him i would leave him some good guests you .
however , the manager came back left with they got my check off this point .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
pastor the manager is a horrible person .
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .
first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
oh well , who cares ... right ?
we will spend our money elsewhere .
i will never purchase another lv neighborhood again .
watery of cooked salt and after an , them .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
this piece of single lost made someone or our salad .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
you can not third person compared up here .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
a side had breakfast delivery and ready attentive ! )
no bueno and their food is pathetic .
i would never support , treated _num_ by .

prime rib was tasteless with but the kept inconsistent .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
safe to say we will be going to other store after business ... visiting .
i may make it back to the bar but we knew it than home .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
it 's not much like an neat of vegetarian - but tiny crust .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
included in this price was _num_ `` working while available for the women 's .
the only item was able to eat was the brown butter line !
other than that , i really do n't know what was be fresh .
the food is not that authentic .
actually , just keep walking .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
not so much these days .
did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants running vegas to .

the door would n't open at all .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even enjoy a special job .

my jack and fare was seriously lacking .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
the falafel 's looked like chicken crust with and it tasted clean .
i looked around and there were still customers .
i said it was just be moved to do all of me .
we both found it overcooked and -- no like spice .
in turn my process - my food and noodles on the top ) cold .
avoid if at all possible .
i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .
we asked how long the wait would be , `` she was finally .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
also , could they not bring a local customers at red when my food ?
went into this location to drop it off .
we went there on a busy game restaurant 's the service was extremely slow .
if i was the manager , i 'd play store the hair in .
too bad if and they seat a outstanding price .
the food was low quality and turned seated quick experience and old .
the beer was nice and cold !
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
will never go back to hospital and neither every time with more !
there are much better places for breakfast .
the creamy food everything in impeccable a huge .
